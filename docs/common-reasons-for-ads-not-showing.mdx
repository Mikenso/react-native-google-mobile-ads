# Common reasons for ads not showing

Use the following guide to understand common reasons why apps show few or no ads.

## Did you recently create your AdMob account?

Wait up to 24 hours after you create your account.
When you first sign up for AdMob, your account is reviewed before it’s approved.
This typically takes up to 24 hours, but in rare cases can take up to 2 weeks.
You’ll be notified via email if your account is not approved by AdMob.  

## Is your app or ad unit new?

Wait up to one hour after you create an app or ad unit.
In some cases, it can take a few days for ads to appear in new apps or ad units.
Note: New iOS apps will not show Google ads until they’re listed in the Apple App Store.
Newly registered apps and newly created ad units typically take up to an hour to activate.
Because of this, you may not see live impressions immediately.

## Test ads not showing up

If you set up an app-ads.txt file for your app, you need to also include this line in your app-ads.txt file in order to load ads using the demo ad units:
`google.com, pub-3940256099942544, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0`

Alternatively, you can enable test devices and use your own ad unit IDs instead.

### Enable test devices

If you want to do more rigorous testing with production-looking ads, you can now configure your device as a test device and use your own ad unit IDs that you've created in the AdMob UI.
Test devices can either be added in the AdMob UI or programmatically using the Google Mobile Ads SDK.

Follow the steps below to add your device as a test device.

#### Add your test device in the AdMob UI
For a simple, non-programmatic way to add a test device and test new or existing app builds, use the AdMob UI.

#### Add your test device programmatically

If you want to test ads in your app as you're developing, follow the steps below to programmatically register your test device.

```js
import mobileAds from 'react-native-google-mobile-ads';

mobileAds()
  .setRequestConfiguration({
    // An array of test device IDs to whitelist.
    testDeviceIdentifiers: ["EMULATOR"]
  })
  .then(() => {
    // Request config successfully set!
  });
```

## Emulator vs real device

In some cases ads won't show up on an emulator but will show up while testing on a real device.
